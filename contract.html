                <h2>Contract, <br><span>Enmanuel Marte</span></h2>
                <p>I, <a href="">Enmanuel Marte</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring of 2022WEB250, Database Driven Websites class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br>
                    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
                    <p>                 
                    Signed: <span>Enmanuel Marte </span> <date> 1/17/2022</date>
                </p>
